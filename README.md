gnome3_extensions
=================

My chosen extensions for GNOME3 working environment

To be placed inside `.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions`

After that you need to activate them by running `gsettings set org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions "['extension_folder_name']"` or via _gnome tweak tool_.
